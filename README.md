# Banker_Algorithm
By Ramone Fields

# Getting Started

The bankers' algorithm for a safe state is demonstrated in this project. Banker's algorithm is a algorithm used to solve deadlock when there are multiple instance per resource type. It will accept a data file as input. The available table must be on the first line, with each integer separated by a space. The second line must begin with Allocation and end with a newline separating the allocation table by a space. Max must follow the allocation table on its own line, followed by a newline with the allocation table separated by space.

# How to run/compile with the following commands. 
$clang++ -std=c++11 banker.cpp

$./a.out
